description: Adopt Polkadot UI in a reactive-dot (PAPI) application
---

## Overview

This guide walks through integrating Polkadot UI with an existing reactive-dot (PAPI) codebase.

### Prerequisites

- reactive-dot and polkadot-api installed
- React 18+ and TypeScript
- Tailwind v4 (recommended)

## Steps

### 1) Install a component

```bash
npx polkadot-ui@latest add address-input
```

The CLI detects PAPI and installs PAPI variants when available.

### 2) Ensure providers are wired

Your app likely has a PAPI provider; otherwise add it at the root:

```tsx
import { PolkadotProvider } from "@/lib/providers/polkadot-provider.papi"

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <PolkadotProvider defaultChain="paseo">{children}</PolkadotProvider>
}
```

### 3) Replace UI progressively

Swap bespoke widgets (address fields, balance views, tx buttons) with Polkadot UI components.

### 4) Keep your data layer

Components accept plain props. Keep your existing reactive-dot subscriptions and pass values into the components.

### 5) Styling

All components are tailwind classes; tune tokens or override classes to match your DS.

## Tips

- Replace leaf components first to avoid large diffs
- Use our examples for PAPI to mirror patterns
- Prefer a single provider instance to share connections across pages
