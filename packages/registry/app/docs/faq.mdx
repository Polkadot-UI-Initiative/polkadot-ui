<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
  <AccordionItem value="telemetry">
    <AccordionTrigger>
    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 pt-0">Does Dot UI collect telemetry?</h2>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>

To help improve the CLI experience, Dot UI collects anonymous usage telemetry by default. This data helps us understand how the CLI is being used and identify areas for improvement.

### What data is collected

The telemetry system tracks:
- Component installation events (success/failure)
- Project initialization events
- Framework type (Next.js or Vite)
- TypeScript and Tailwind CSS usage
- Package manager used (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
- Operation duration (for performance improvements)
- CLI version
- Error messages (truncated to protect sensitive data)

### Privacy

- **No personal information** is collected (no usernames, project names, or file paths)
- **No code or component content** is transmitted
- Data is only used in aggregate to improve the CLI
- Telemetry **fails silently** and will never break your CLI operations

### Disabling telemetry

You can disable telemetry in several ways:

**Environment variable (recommended):**
```bash
export POLKA_UI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

**Per-command using dev flag:**
```bash
npx polkadot-ui add button --dev
```

**Permanently in your shell profile:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.
export POLKA_UI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

Telemetry is automatically disabled when using the `--dev` flag for local development.

    <AccordionTrigger>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 pt-0">Why should I use Polkadot UI?</h2>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Polkadot UI provides production‑ready, accessible components optimized for Polkadot apps.

      ### UX
      - Opinionated defaults for spacing, typography, and state feedback
      - Consistent micro‑interactions and loading states to reduce layout shift
      - Patterns for wallet connection, account selection, and transactions

      ### Accessibility (a11y)
      - ARIA‑correct inputs, live regions, focus handling, and high contrast
      - Keyboard navigable dialogs, menus, and listboxes using Radix + shadcn
      - Reduced‑motion friendly animations; skeletons avoid content jumps

      ### Save time
      - Drop‑in blocks for common flows (Network Indicator, Tx Button, Require Account)
      - Works with both PAPI and dedot, so you don’t have to rebuild integration layers
      - Typed APIs, examples, and docs so you can ship faster with confidence

    <AccordionTrigger>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 pt-0">Can it work with my existing app?</h2>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. Polkadot UI is framework‑friendly and modular.

      - Works with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Vite/React** out of the box
      - Choose your runtime: **polkadot‑api (PAPI)** or **dedot/typink**, or both
      - Components are tree‑shakable and styled with Tailwind + shadcn (no global CSS required)
      - Start with isolated widgets (e.g., Network Indicator, Tx Button), then adopt more
      - You can wrap your app in the provided providers or bring your own and wire the services layer
