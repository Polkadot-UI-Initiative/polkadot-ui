# MCP Server

Use the Polkadot-UI MCP server to browse, search, and install Polkadot
components from registries directly into your project.

The Polkadot-UI MCP Server allows AI agents (such as Cursor) to interact with
Polkadot UI components from registries. You can browse available components,
search for specific ones, and install them directly into your project using
natural language.

For example, you can ask an AI agent to "Add a wallet connection component to my
project" or "Show me all available Polkadot UI components for balance display".

---

## How It Works

The MCP server acts as a bridge between your AI agent, the Polkadot-UI component
registries, and the Polkadot-UI CLI.

1. **Registry Connection** - MCP connects to Polkadot-UI registries (papi or
   dedot)
2. **Natural Language** - You describe what you need in plain English
3. **AI Processing** - The agent translates your request into registry commands
4. **Component Delivery** - Polkadot UI components are fetched and installed in
   your project with automatic API setup

The server provides access to:

- **Browse Components** - List all available Polkadot UI components from any
  configured registry
- **Search Across Registries** - Find specific components by name or
  functionality across papi and dedot registries
- **Install with Natural Language** - Add components using simple conversational
  prompts like "add an address input component"
- **Automatic Setup** - Components are installed with all required dependencies,
  Polkadot API configuration, and TypeScript types, ready to go

---

## Installation

Currently, the Polkadot-UI MCP server only supports **Cursor**. Support for
other MCP clients will be added in future releases.

### Cursor

To configure MCP in Cursor, add the Polkadot-UI server to your project's
`.cursor/mcp.json` configuration file:

```json title=".cursor/mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polkadot-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["polkadot-ui@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, enable the Polkadot-UI MCP server in Cursor
Settings.

Or you can also click the "Add MCP to Cursor" button in the hero section of the
[home page](https://polkadot-ui.com), then Open in Cursor, and enable the
server.

Once enabled, you should see a green dot next to the polkadot-ui server in the
MCP server list and a list of available tools:

- `add_component` - Add a Polkadot UI component to your project
- `list_components` - List all available Polkadot UI components
- `init_project` - Initialize a new project with Polkadot UI components
- `manage_telemetry` - Manage telemetry settings and display privacy information

## How to Interact

Once the MCP server is configured, you can use natural language to interact with
Polkadot-UI registries. The server supports two different registry types:

- **papi** - Components built with Polkadot-API
- **dedot** - Components built with Dedot

### Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:

#### Add Component

Install a Polkadot UI component to your project with automatic setup:

- Installs the component and all dependencies
- Sets up Polkadot API configuration
- Configures providers and chain connections
- Generates TypeScript types

#### List Components

Browse all available components from the registry with:

- Component descriptions
- Required dependencies
- Registry dependencies (other components)
- API requirements

#### Initialize Project

Create a new project with Polkadot UI components:

- Framework selection (Next.js or Vite)
- TypeScript and ESLint setup
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- shadcn/ui initialization
- Polkadot library selection (papi or dedot)

#### Manage Telemetry

Control telemetry settings and view privacy information:

- Check telemetry status
- Enable or disable telemetry
- View privacy information

## Examples

Here are some example prompts you can use with the Polkadot-UI MCP server:

### Browse & Search

- "Show me all available Polkadot UI components"
- "List components from the papi registry"
- "Find me a wallet connection component"
- "What balance display components are available?"

### Install Components

- "Add the address-input component to my project"
- "Install a wallet connect component using papi"
- "Add a transaction button component"
- "Install the balance-display component with verbose output"

### Project Setup

- "Initialize a new Polkadot UI project"
- "Create a new project with Next.js and papi"
- "Set up a new project using the dedot registry"

### Component Information

- "Show me details about the tx-button component"
- "What dependencies does the address-input component need?"
- "List all components that work with polkadot-api"

### Development & Testing

- "Add components from the development registry"
- "List components with verbose output"
- "Force install the select-token component"

---

## Available Components

The Polkadot-UI registry includes the following components:

### Input Components

- **address-input** - Address input with SS58/Ethereum validation and identity
  lookup
- **amount-input** - Amount input component for token values

### Wallet & Account

- **connect-wallet** - Connect to wallets and select accounts
- **account-info** - Display identity, balances and network details
- **require-account** - Conditional rendering based on account selection
- **require-connection** - Conditional rendering based on chain connection

### Balance & Token

- **balance-display** - Formatted on-chain balance display
- **select-token** - Token selection dropdown with balance display
- **select-token-dialog** - Token selection dialog with search

### Transaction

- **tx-button** - Submit transactions with progress updates
- **tx-notification** - Transaction status notifications

### Network

- **network-indicator** - Chain connection and block status indicator

Each component comes with:

- Automatic Polkadot API setup
- Required dependency installation
- TypeScript type generation
- Provider configuration
- Chain connection setup

## Registry Types

The MCP server supports two registry types. It will detect if you have papi or
dedot installed and use the appropriate registry.
