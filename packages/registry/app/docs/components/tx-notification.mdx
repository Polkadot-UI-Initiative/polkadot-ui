## Introduction

`tx-notification` provides a simple API to show toast notifications for the full transaction lifecycle — from signing to submission, inclusion, and finalization. It integrates with your chain metadata to show a chain logo and optional explorer link.

## Installation

```bash
npx polkadot-ui@latest add tx-notification
```

## Usage

## API

- `beginTxStatusNotification({ network, title, description, toastId? })`: Shows an initial loading toast and returns a `toastId`.
- `txStatusNotification({ result, toastId, network, successDuration?, title?, titles?, descriptions? })`: Updates the toast based on the tx status (`Broadcasting` → `BestChainBlockIncluded` → `Finalized`).
- `cancelTxStatusNotification({ toastId, network, title?, description? })`: Replaces the toast with an error/cancelled state.

All examples above focus on dedot, but the API is provider-agnostic as long as you pass `result.status.type` and a compatible `network` object.
